MaxiCube
========

This is an example 3D puzzle game using Marmalade Core C++ SDK and libraries.

It is based on the existing project here: https://github.com/marmalade/gbsgamejam/tree/master/CPPGameTemplate

It requires these two projects to be placed wither next to it or on
marmalade's global serach paths:
 - IwEngineCore (very lightweight 3D engine) https://github.com/nickchops/IwEngineCore
 - IwSound (imporved version of similarly-named example that ships with Marmalade) https://github.com/nickchops/IwSound

A tutorial based around this project is in the Marmalade official docs here:
http://docs.madewithmarmalade.com/x/uQXH

Eventually the sub projects should get integrated into the SDK.

The model_source folder contains the Blender sources scene and textures which were exported and converted to create the ones in the data folder.
